Chatbot with Python
# BY Mohamed fares

This code defines a chatbot using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library in Python. The chatbot is initialized with a set of patterns and responses that allow it to engage in a conversational dialogue with a user.

The `pairs` list contains the patterns and corresponding responses that the chatbot will use to respond to user input.
Each pattern is a regular expression that matches a user's input, and the corresponding response is a list of possible responses that the chatbot can provide.

The `reflections` dictionary is used to map certain words in the user's input to their corresponding "reflections" (e.g. "I am" -> "you are"). This helps the chatbot provide more natural and contextual responses.

The `my_dummy_reflections` dictionary is an example of additional reflections that can be defined and used by the chatbot.

The chatbot is then created using the `Chat` class from the `nltk.chat.util` module, and the `converse()` method is called to start the conversation.
